# No Code Replica

This is a replica of [no-code website](https://go.growthschool.io/no-code), initialised via PHP and rendered via React.
To run the app, follow the steps -

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the folder in terminal
3. Install node_modules with `npm install`
4. Compile LESS to CSS with `npx gulp less`
5. Compile React App with `npm run build`
6. Run a local php server `php -S localhost:8000`

That's it.
Note: If you want to run the site on some other domain/port, replace `$BASE_URL` variable in `index.php` file.
